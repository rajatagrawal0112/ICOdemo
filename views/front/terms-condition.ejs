                                        <p>The ARTW token for sale does not have the legal qualification of a security, since it does not give any rights to dividends or interests.

                                        <p>ARTW Tokens cannot have a performance or a particular value outside our network, hence these tokens are not to be used or purchased for speculative or investment purposes. The purchaser of tokens is aware that national securities laws, which ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection, are not applicable. Anyone purchasing our token expressly acknowledges and represents that she/he has carefully reviewed whitepaper and fully understands the risks, costs and benefits associated with the purchase of the token.</p>
                                        <p><strong>General Knowledge</strong></p>
                                        <p>The purchaser of ARTW Token undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks associated with the crowdsale as well as the mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies (incl. storage) in their respective geographies. ARTW  or any of the related parties or management or any employee shall not be responsible for any loss of tokens or situations making it impossible to access their tokens, like loss of passwords or any other actions which may result from any actions or omissions of the user or any person undertaking to acquire such tokens, as well as in case of hacker attacks.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
                                        <p>Acquiring ARTW tokens and storing them involves various risks, in particular the risk that ARTW  may not be able to launch its operations and develop its blockchain and provide the services promised. Therefore, and prior to acquiring tokens, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring such tokens in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, obtain any independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept or to understand the risks associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development of our platform, or licenses to operate) or any other risks as indicated in the Terms &amp; Conditions should NOT acquire our tokens.</p>
